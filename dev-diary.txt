    * figure out how to set up type annotations
    * figure out how to set up rubocop in vscode (extension doesn't seem to like my rbenv setup)

"There is good support for functional programming with first-class functions, anonymous functions, and closures."
    :)

"You never directly access attributes. With Ruby, it’s all method calls."
"Parentheses for method calls are usually optional."
    :(

"There’s public, private, and protected to enforce access, instead of Python’s _voluntary_ underscore __convention__."
    i like that

"When tested for truth, only false and nil evaluate to a false value. Everything else is true (including 0, 0.0, "", and [])."

dict syntax
    { "one" => "eins", "two" => "zwei", "three" => "drei" }
    "hashes" not dicts

These ratings are not strings. When you place a colon in front of a simple word,
you get a symbol. Symbols are cheaper than strings (in terms of computer
memory.) If you use a word over and over in your program, use a symbol. Rather
than having thousands of copies of that word in memory, the computer will store
the symbol only once.
    :foo

working through https://try.ruby-lang.org/

.each can be called on numbers, arrays, hashes, takes a block
.select lets you filter, also takes a block

    def print_plays(year_from, year_to)
    get_shakey["William Shakespeare"]
        .select { |k, v|
        year_from <= v["finished"] &&
        year_to   >= v["finished"]
        }.each { |k, v|
        puts "#{v["title"].ljust(30)} #{v["finished"]}"
        }
    end
    print_plays(1600, 1605)

    First replace Jimmy with #{}. If Ruby sees a hash symbol # followed by a curly
    brace { it looks for a variable between the first brace and the following
    closing brace }. So we can use this: “Hi, my name is #{name}”.

    class Blurb
    attr_accessor :content, :time, :mood

    def initialize(mood, content="")
        @time    = Time.now
        @content = content[0..39]
        @mood    = mood
    end
    end

    Blurb.new(:sick).time

so @ is basically self

    class Blurbalizer
    def initialize(title)
        @title  = title
        @blurbs = [] # A fresh clean array
                    # for storing Blurbs
    end

    def add_a_blurb(mood, content)
        # The << means add to the end of the array
        @blurbs << Blurb.new(mood, content)
    end

    def show_timeline
        puts "Blurbify: #{@title} has #{@blurbs.count} Blurbs"

        @blurbs.sort_by { |t|
        t.time
        }.reverse.each { |t|
        puts "#{t.content.ljust(40)} #{t.time}"
        }
    end
    end

    myapp = Blurbalizer.new "The Big Blurb"

so you append to a list by doing list << new_item

ok done w tryruby
let's do an aoc problem
starting 2021
